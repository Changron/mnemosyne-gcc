MNEMOSYNE OVERVIEW:

New storage-class memory (SCM) technologies, such as phase-change memory, 
STT-RAM, and memristors, promise user-level access to non-volatile storage 
through regular memory instructions. These memory devices enable fast 
user-mode access to persistence, allowing regular in-memory data structures 
to survive system crashes.

Mnemosyne provides a simple interface for programming with persistent 
memory. Mnemosyne addresses two challenges: how to create and manage such 
memory, and how to ensure consistency in the presence of failures. Without 
additional mechanisms, a system failure may leave data structures in SCM in 
an invalid state, crashing the program the next time it starts.

In Mnemosyne, programmers declare global persistent data with the keyword 
persistent or allocate it dynamically. Mnemosyne provides primitives for 
directly modifying persistent variables and supports consistent updates 
through a lightweight transaction mechanism. Compared to past work on 
disk-based persistent memory, Mnemosyne is much lighter weight, as it can 
store data items as small as a word rather than a virtual memory page. In 
tests emulating the performance characteristics of forthcoming SCMs, we 
find that Mnemosyne provides a 20--280 percent performance increase for 
small data sizes over alternative persistence strategies, such as 
Berkeley DB or Boost serialization that are designed for disks.
