DEPENDENCIES
============

Part of this subtree is built using Make so you need to prepare those
parts of the tree accordingly.


BerkeleyDB 

 1) cd $USERMODE/bench/kvstore/bdb/build_unix
 2) ../dist/configure
 3) make

TokyoCabinet

 1) cd $USERMODE/bench/kvstore/tc/library-base
 2) ./configure CC=icc --disable-shared
 3) cd $USERMODE/bench/kvstore/tc/library-mtm
 4) ./configure CC=icc --disable-shared

 Note: Unfortunately, trying to config/build in another directory won't work
 as TC's Makefile searches the local path for dependencies

- Integrate Makefiles into Scons for a hassle-free built.
