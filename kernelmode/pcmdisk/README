PCMDISK is a block device driver based on ramdisk (drivers/block/brd.c) to
emulate a block device on top of PCM memory.

FILES
=====
brd.c, pcm.c    : The pcmdisk kernel-module.
user_control.c  : User-mode application to control the pcmdisk kernel module. 
fs.sh           : Script to load and create a filesystem on top of pcmdisk, 
                  and to unload pcmdisk.


BUILDING PCMDISK
================
Makefile may be used to build the kernel-module. Please make sure the 
makefile variable $KERNEL_SOURCE points to the right kernel source tree.

Several parameters may be changed to configure PCMDISK as needed:
- pcm.h: PCM_EMULATE_CRASH   : To emulate crashes
         PCM_EMULATE_LATENCY : To emulate latency
         PCM_CPUFREQ         : To set the CPU frequency
         PCM_LATENCY_WRITE   : To set the latency writing to PCM

- brd.c: CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PCM_SIZE : To set the size of the PCMDISK
